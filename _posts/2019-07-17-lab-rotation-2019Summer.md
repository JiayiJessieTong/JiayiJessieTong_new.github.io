My first lab rotation at Penn is done! It is my honor to have the opportunity to rotate in Dr. Yong Chen's lab this summer. The project we've been working on is called: "Proportional Likelihood Ratio Model for Sparse Data". It was a pleasure working with Dr. Chen! I look forward to working with Dr. Chen on more projects in the future!
